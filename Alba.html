        Alba,
      </p>
      <p>
        I have only written down 15 things I love about you, but I could have easily listed dozens more, honestly. The past five years with you have been the happiest years of my life. You've transformed me in ways I never thought possible. You've shown me how to love and have made me a better manâ€”the man I am today and one that I'm truly proud of.
      </p>
      <p>
        I understand that the past year hasn't been the best for us, and we've faced some challenging moments. But I want you to know that I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make this work. I've realized how much this relationship means to me, and I admit that I haven't been putting in the effort recently. I hope you know this can change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, I'm ready. Ready to let go of my fears and hold nothing back. I want us to experience the full potential of our relationship. I want to build a future together with you. Deep within my heart and mind, I know that you are the one.
      </p>
      <p>
        For these reasons, and as I've mentioned to you before, I believe we're ready to take the next step in our relationship and move forward together. I promise you that I will come to Lyon by the end of the year. This time, I am determined and committed to making it happen for real. I am incredibly excited about starting this new chapter of our lives together, and I am confident that it will be just as good, if not better, than the previous one.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love you.
        Yacine
